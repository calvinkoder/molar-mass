Molar Mass Calculator [C]
by Calvin Koder

Input: Chemical formula
Output: Molar mass (g/mol)

ex.
./chem C6H12O6
180.155884

This program calculates the molar mass of the given molecule. Molar mass is the mass of one mole (6.02*10^28 particles) of the molecule. 
It is calculated by multiplying the number of each element in the molecule by the element's atmoic mass (which is the average molar mass of that element). 

Input notes:
Only capitalized letters are allowed
ex. CA (*), Ca (x)

If there is only one of an element in the formula, write a '1' afterwards
ex. C1O2 (*), CO2(x)

All elements up to 118 are included. Their atomic masses are stored in periodic-data.csv. 
This may include outdated names for certain elements, so refer to it if there is any problem with that.
